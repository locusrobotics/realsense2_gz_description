# Realsense Gazebo description

[![Format Status](https://github.com/MarqRazz/realsense2_gz_description/actions/workflows/format.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MarqRazz/realsense2_gz_description/actions/workflows/format.yaml)

Description: This ROS 2 package is designed to be used in unison with [realsense2_description](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/tree/ros2-master/realsense2_description) and allows for easy definition of Realsense cameras that can be simulated in Gazebo Fortress and newer. It may support other versions of Gazebo but this has not been tested.

## Running Example Launch

This package includes a launch file to start Gazebo, bridge the data to ROS 2 and display the simulated camera data in Rviz.

Once you have built this package and sourced your workspace you can run
```bash
ros2 launch realsense2_gz_description example_realsense_gazebo.launch.py
```

> Note: you can specify `headless:=false` and it will also open the Gazebo GUI.

Which should start a simulated camera in Gazebo with a few objects in front of it. In the Rviz window that launches you can see the RGB images streaming along with the point cloud in the main view.

# Example Usage in URDF

In your robots urdf.xacro include the desired Realsense model along with its Gazebo description.
```xml
<xacro:include filename="$(find realsense2_description)/urdf/_d415.urdf.xacro" />
<xacro:include filename="$(find realsense2_gz_description)/urdf/_d415.gazebo.xacro" />

```
Then call the xacros and specify the same `name` and other optional arguments.
```xml
<!-- URDF xacro-->
<xacro:sensor_d415 parent="world" name="$(arg camera_name)" ...>
  <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
</xacro:sensor_d415>
<!-- Gazebo xacro-->
<xacro:gazebo_d415 name="$(arg camera_name)" .../>
```

> Note: Gazebo plugins can only be included once so the xacros in this repo assume that a parent will include/run the required Sensors plugin when starting simulation.
This plugin can be started from your URDF or world.sdf file.
```xml
<gazebo>
  <plugin filename="gz-sim-sensors-system" name="gz::sim::systems::Sensors">
    <render_engine>ogre2</render_engine>
  </plugin>
</gazebo>
```

you can also refer to the the [example.urdf.xacro](./urdf/example_d415_gazebo.urdf.xacro) included.

## Gazebo only features

Gazebo offers a triggered based RGB camera that can be enabled by passing `triggered="true"` to the Gazebo description xacro.
Currently this feature does not appear to not work with the RGBD sensor, but will hopefully be added soon.
Switching the camera to only `trigger` when requested allows developers to better control the computation load required by each sensor.
Note triggering is not a feature the Realsense hardware offers unfortunately.

To trigger the camera from the command line you can publish on the Gazebo topic `camera_name/trigger`.
```bash
ign topic -t "/name/trigger" -m Boolean -p "data: true" -n 1
```

pre-commit is a tool to automatically run formatting checks on each commit, which saves you from manually running them.
This repo requires formatting to pass before changes will be accepted.

Install pre-commit like this:

```
pip3 install pre-commit
```

Run this in the top directory of the repo to set up the git hooks:

```
